# About
This is a React Native project where you play TicTacToe against ChatGPT. Every time the board changes is updated (when the user makes a move) ChatGPT is notified and is prompted to make it's next move. ChatGPT's response is parsed into a readable format and the move is executed. I made this project to learn more about React Native and using the OpenAI API.

# Setup
1) Clone the project
2) Create a .env file in the root directory and paste in OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
3) Run the project with the command "npx expo start"
